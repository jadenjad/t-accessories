# T-Accessories

## Description

T-accessories is a simple mod for Minecraft 1.16.5, implementing the Curios 1.16.5 API found here: https://github.com/TheIllusiveC4/Curios. This mod adds various Terraria accesories to the game using Curios as the base for accesory slots.

## Features

* **Fully functional acessories**    - The accesories added by this mod doesn't change the way vanilla Minecraft is played, but still adds extra movement and utility functionality that can heighten the vanilla experience.
* **Non-intrusive features**   - These items are implemented in a way that allows stackable effects with potions and enchantments that allows for seamless integration with the base game.
* **Compatible with other Curios-based mods**   - Items work in any Curios slot, making them flexible with any other mods implementing the Curios API
* **Continued Support**    - New items are being worked on and added continually, until (hopefully) every Terraria accessory has been added!
* **Custom Art**   - Recreated pixel art of items to more closely match with vanilla Minecraft
